Life Cycle of a Data Science Project:

1. Problem Understanding
2. Data Collection
3. Data Cleaning and Exploration
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Creation and Implementation

1. Problem Understanding:
   - Clearly define what you're trying to achieve
   - Decide how you'll measure success
   - Figure out what type of problem you're dealing with (like classification or regression)

2. Data Collection:
   - Gather information from various sources
   - Make sure the data is relevant to your problem
   - Consider different aspects of the data like amount, type, speed of generation, and accuracy

3. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
   - EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Clean up the data by dealing with missing information and removing duplicates
   - Analyze the data to understand its characteristics
   - Prepare the data to minimize errors

4. Feature Engineering:
   - Choose the most relevant characteristics of your data
   - Create new useful features that could improve your model
   - Reduce the number of features if there are too many
   - Pick the most important features for your model

5. Model Creation and Implementation:
   - Select suitable algorithms and train your models
   - Test how well your model performs using cross-validation
   - Put your model to use, either for real-time applications or batch processing
