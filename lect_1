What is Data Science?
Data Science involves analyzing and working with different types of data (like text, images, audio, or video) to make predictions about future scenarios and offer useful suggestions through recommendation systems.
Data Science vs AI vs ML:
Data Science forms the foundation for both AI and ML. It includes math, statistics, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is about creating systems that can make decisions on their own. It's like giving a brain to a computer so it can think for itself. Examples are Amazon Echo and Google Assistant.
ML (Machine Learning) is a part of AI. It's used to make recommendations based on past data or experiences. For instance, when Netflix suggests movies or Amazon recommends products, that's ML in action.
AI is the biggest category, which includes ML. ML, in turn, includes Deep Learning. So the relationship goes: AI > ML > Deep Learning.
Deep Learning uses artificial neurons to solve complex problems.
Remember: AI is the broadest field, then comes ML, and Deep Learning is a specific type of ML.
