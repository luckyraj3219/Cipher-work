### Hypothesis Testing

**Definition:**
Hypothesis testing is a statistical technique used to make decisions based on sample data. It helps determine if there is enough evidence to support a certain belief about the entire population.

**Steps in Hypothesis Testing:**
1. **State the Hypotheses:**
   - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** This is a statement that there is no effect or difference. It represents the idea of "no change" or "no difference."
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** This statement contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests that there is an effect or difference.
2. **Choose a Significance Level (α):** Commonly set at 0.05, which means there is a 5% risk of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
3. **Collect Data and Compute a Test Statistic:** Use statistical methods appropriate for your data and hypothesis.
4. **Determine the P-value:** This is the probability of observing results as extreme as those in your sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true.
5. **Make a Decision:** Compare the P-value with the significance level. If the P-value is less than α, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, do not reject it.

**Types of Tests:**
1. **Z-test**
2. **T-test**
3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**
4. **Chi-square Test**

**Example Scenario:**
A basketball coach claims his team scores more than 50 points per game on average. We test this claim with scores from 5 randomly selected games.

1. **State the Hypotheses:**
   - H₀: μ = 50 (The average score is 50 points.)
   - H₁: μ > 50 (The average score is more than 50 points.)
2. **Collect Data:** The sample mean score is 51.2.
3. **Comparison:** Compare 51.2 to the hypothesized mean of 50.
4. **Make a Decision:** If 51.2 is significantly higher than 50, we reject H₀ in favor of H₁.

In this example, the sample mean of 51.2 suggests the team's average score is indeed higher than 50, supporting the coach's claim.

**Applications:**
1. **A/B Testing (Marketing and Product Development):**
   - **Example:** An e-commerce site tests two homepage designs (A and B) to see which leads to higher sales.
   - **Hypotheses:**
     - H₀: No difference in sales between the two designs.
     - H₁: Design B increases sales compared to Design A.
2. **Medicine and Healthcare:**
   - **Example:** Testing a new drug to lower blood pressure.
   - **Hypotheses:**
     - H₀: The new drug has no effect on blood pressure.
     - H₁: The new drug affects blood pressure.

### Inferential Statistics

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Population and Sample:**
   - **Population:** The entire group you want to learn about.
   - **Sample:** A smaller group selected from the population to represent it.

**Estimation:**
- **Point Estimation:** Uses sample data to estimate a population parameter (e.g., mean or proportion).
- **Interval Estimation (Confidence Intervals):** Provides a range where the parameter likely falls, with a certain confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%).

**Common Point Estimators:**
- **Sample Mean (x̄):** Estimates the Population Mean (μ).
- **Sample Proportion (p̂):** Estimates the Population Proportion (P).
- **Sample Variance (s²):** Estimates the Population Variance (σ²).

**Example:**
If you have test scores from a sample of students and calculate the average score, that average (sample mean) estimates the average score for the entire class.

**Components of Confidence Intervals:**
- **Confidence Level:** Usually a percentage (e.g., 95% or 99%) indicating the probability that the confidence interval includes the true population parameter.
- **Margin of Error:** The range above and below the point estimate within which the true parameter is expected to fall.

**Formula for Confidence Interval for a Population Mean:**
\[ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm \left( z \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]
where:
- \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean.
- \(z\) is the z-score for the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for 95% confidence).
- \(s\) is the sample standard deviation.
- \(n\) is the sample size.
