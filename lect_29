### Introduction to Machine Learning

**What is AI?**

**Definition:** AI (Artificial Intelligence) is when machines are made to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.  
**Alternate Definition:** It's the capability of a computer to think and learn like a human.

**Key Terms in AI:**
- **Learning:** An AI system's ability to improve its performance based on experience.
- **Reasoning:** The process of making logical conclusions from given information.
- **Self-Correction:** The ability of an AI system to automatically fix its own mistakes.

**Types of AI:**
1. **Weak AI (Narrow AI):** AI systems designed and trained for specific tasks.
2. **Strong AI (General AI):** AI systems with human-like cognitive abilities, capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can.

**What is Machine Learning (ML)?**

**Definition:** Machine Learning is a part of AI that uses statistical methods to help machines improve their performance as they are fed more data.  
**Analogy:**
- **Human Learning:** Observations → Learning → Skills
- **Machine Learning:** Data → Model → Predictions

**Types of Machine Learning:**

1. **Supervised Learning:**
   - **Description:** Uses labeled data to train the model.
   - **Process:** Labeled Data & Labels → Machine → ML Model → Predictions → Test Data

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - **Description:** Uses unlabeled data to identify patterns.
   - **Process:** Data → Model → Groups/Clusters
   - **Clustering:** Grouping similar instances based on patterns in the data.

**Examples:**
1. **Supervised Learning:** Classifying emails as spam or not, identifying cats and dogs in images.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Grouping cats and dogs based on features.
3. **Both Supervised and Unsupervised:** Recommendation systems, playing strategy games like AlphaGo.

**Evolution of AI, ML, and Deep Learning:**
- **Artificial Intelligence (1950s-1980s):** Techniques enabling computers to mimic human behavior.
- **Machine Learning (1980s-2010s):** AI techniques that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning (2010s onwards):** A subset of ML that allows the computation of multi-layer neural networks.

**What is Data Science?**

**Definition:** Data Science is a field that uses statistical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.  
**Sources of Data:** Databases, business transactions, sensors, etc.  
**Techniques Used:** Data science applies complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
